## Survive and reproduce

In previous chapter, I explained that two main human instincts are to survive and reproduce. That means that we as beings are shaped to accomplish these two. In evolutive process we were left with most important abbilities, to be able to do that... 

Since males and females have different biological role in reproduction, we are quite different after so many years of evolution. Men are more efficient in reproduction if they have as much sex with as much women as possible. On the other hand, women try to find best source of good genes for their children. 

This is why women have double standards. There are men with good genes that can satisfy them sexualy and give them fun (lovers) and there are stable rich, smart men who can take care of them throught a life (providers) . 

Phenomens of friendzone and providersraising kids without knowing that they are not biologicaly related come from this also. 

Some women find both lover and provider in one man, but, most of them do not.
