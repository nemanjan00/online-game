## Evolution

First mistake most people make is that they do not think about most important process that shaped us... Evolution. 

To be able to understand human nature, we first need to know what we are, as empty shell, without influence of society. 

To be able to do that, we start with thinking about babies... Before being born, baby is "manufactured" from genes... 

### Gene selection

Gene selection is evolutive process that we have to thank for big part of what we are today. Genes describe what we are, how do we look, our instincts, etc. 

For understanding what we need to understand, it is important for us to take a look at instincts that survived evolution. 

### Survive and reproduce

Evolution is first of all test if creatures are able to survive long enough to reproduce. So, most important instincts are survival and reproduction. 

These two are in core of every creature including humans.
