## Evolution

First mistake most people make is that they do not think about most important process that shaped us... Evolution. 

To be able to understand human nature, we first need to know what we are, as empty shell, without influence of society. 

To be able to do that, we start with thinking about babies... Before being born, baby is "manufactured" from genes... 

### Gene selection

Gene selection is evolutive process that we have to thank for big part of what we are today. Genes describe what we are, how do we look, our instincts, etc. 

For understanding what we need to understand, it is important for us to take a look at instincts that survived evolution. 

#### Survive and reproduce

Evolution is first of all test if creatures are able to survive long enough to reproduce. So, most important instincts are survival and reproduction. 

These two are in core of every creature including humans and are very important for understanding seduction. 

#### Anxiety

Most of animals move and live in groups... There are alfa and beta males. Alfas are leading rest of the group, protecting them, hunting... 

When it is time to reproduce, alfas choose best females and betas stay aside... If betas get involved, they get killed by alfas... 

As a humans, we are not too much different than animals. Hundreds years ago, we also used to be like that. If man approached wrong woman, he would get killed. 

That is one of main reasons men today are afraid to approach women. 

That means that we all have some amount of anxiety and what matters is if we can manage to control it.
