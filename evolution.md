## Evolution

First mistake most people make is that they do not think about most important process that shaped us... Evolution. 

To be able to understand human nature, we first need to know what we are, as empty shell, without influence of society. 

To be able to do that, we start with thinking about babies... Before being born, baby is "manufactured" from genes... 

### Gene selection

Gene selection is evolutive process that we have to thank for big part of what we are today. 

### Survive and reproduce

Thanks to evolution, only creatures with instincts to survive and reproduce made it to today. 

We can use these to as main instincts, to be able to develop deeper understanding of human nature.
